# Salary Calculator

## Description

For this project I decided to add some extra feature in addition to the requirements.
## I added
- Refresh Persistence using localStorage
- Instead of using innerHTML I use a HTML template element and the addEventListener method.

Additional README details can be found [here](https://github.com/PrimeAcademy/readme-template/blob/master/README.md).
